            Add module for working with caching services, currently
            only Memcache is supported.
        </log>
        <log>
            Add support for controllers inside of packages, previously
            only a single namespace was supported.
            <br/>
            <i>Note that this
            feature is probably going to be moved into a FileMapper so
            the StandardMapper can move to more of a map based
            model.</i>

        <log>
            Add render method to pager.Pager for those that want to
            subclass the output.  The base method simply returns the
            pager unmodified.
